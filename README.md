## Project Proposal

User Story

```
AS AN avid fitness nerd, or someone trying to lose the COVID 15
I WANT a fitness application that can track my workouts and daily nutriton
SO THAT I can glean what my progress is at any point in time towards my goals
```

Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN that I am attempting to track my health and wellbeing progress
WHEN I arrive at the site
THEN I am given a dashboard showing all entries to date thus far
WHEN I select one of the journal entires
THEN I am taken to a view displaying all entered exercise/nutrition information in a post type view
WHEN I want to add a new entry
THEN I am taken to a form view that will prompt for the user to select what activity(ies) I did and what they ate.
WHEN I want to set a fitness goal for overall time spent active
THEN I am shown a form that allows me to enter my time goal
WHEN I want to see my progress on any given goal and click on one
THEN I am shown a visual indicator or the progress thus far (hitting a goal will do something amazing)
```

## Usage

## Future Development

Ideas for future development include but are not limited to the following:

-   Ability to track specific activity metrics and load them based on the category. (Ex. If the category for an activity is 'Run', we will record metrics such as Pace, Total Time Run, and Distance. If the user selects 'Biking' the forms will load with and track Distance, Pace, Elevation Change, etc.)
-   Rewards/Accomplishment functionality. When a user hits their goals there could be a trophy case displaying these to the user and others that view profiles.
-   A social media communnity aspect. The next iteration of this application could serve as a platform for sharing in the future.
-   The ability to tap into other fitness web API's in order to share and syncronize data. (Ex. Garmin, Nike, Strava, etc.)
